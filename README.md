# Inelastic Structure

all units are SI (N, m, s)


## TODO:

- solve some big examples
- clean and use classes
- calculate responses in every load increment
- include hardening and softening
- visualizations
- separate loading from structure
- add plate element
- dynamic analysis
- add more elements
- optimize code to full usage of numpy (remove for loops, ...)
- improve performance (run every massive calculation with numpy)
- use sifting
- upgrade plate to polygon elements
- multiprocess
- do TODOs
