- use update inverse of B matrix instead of direct inversion.
- optimize code to full usage of numpy (remove for loops, ...)
- optimize code structure (use classes, ...)
- improve performance (using numba or cython)
- do TODOs
- use sifting
- upgrade to polygon elements
- include hardening and softening
