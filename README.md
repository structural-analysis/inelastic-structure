# Inelastic Structure

all units are SI (N, m, s)


## TODO:

- separate material and section (changes all classes and csvs)
- change rblp algorithm to mahini algorithm
- use update inverse of B matrix instead of direct inversion.
- optimize code to full usage of numpy (remove for loops, ...)
- optimize code structure (use classes, ...)
- improve performance (using numba or cython)
- use sifting
- upgrade to polygon elements
- include hardening and softening
- do TODOs
